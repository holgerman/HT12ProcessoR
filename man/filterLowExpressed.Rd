\usage{
filterLowExpressed(
  ht12object,
  paramfile = NULL,
  filter1ind_expressedGenes = "from_paramfile",
  filter1probes_expressedProbes = "from_paramfile"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ht12object}{A list object of class HT12prepro created with function createExpressionSet()}

\item{paramfile}{Path to the file specifying parameters.}

\item{filter1ind_expressedGenes}{Filter for extreme number of 'Detected.Genes..0.01.' at detection p-value 0.01. Valid is: 'Detected.Genes..0.01.' < Median - [value]x IQR AND > Median - [value]x IQR.  If "from_paramfile", than the parameter will be read from the paramfile with the location of this file given in parameter paramfile}

\item{filter1probes_expressedProbes}{Attribute asigning an expression probe as 'expressed' if detected within at least [value]x n(individuals) at detection p-value 0.05.  If "from_paramfile", than the parameter will be read from the paramfile with the location of this file given in parameter paramfile.}
}
\value{
A list object of class HT12prepro  where the slot with  sample-related attributes of the current processing-stage named `$chipsamples` is updated.  Excluded individual are characterized by column in_study ==F and reason4exclusion. Additionally, a slot with the detailed probe-related expression level information named `$genesdetail is created, and the slot with the history of the commands named `$history`` is updated.
